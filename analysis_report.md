# PaMerB Electric Callout Test Analysis

## Current Issues Identified

### 1. **Welcome Node Problems**
- **Issue**: The welcome node (with all the DTMF options) is labeled as "Invalid Input" instead of "Welcome"
- **Impact**: Makes it confusing to identify the main entry point
- **Root Cause**: Node labeling logic is picking the wrong part of the text

### 2. **Missing DTMF Mappings**
- **Issue**: The welcome node should handle choices 1, 3, 7, 9 but only shows choice "3"
- **Expected**: `{"1": "Employee Verification", "3": "Need More Time", "7": "Not Home", "9": "Repeat"}`
- **Actual**: `{"3": "Second Message", "error": "Invalid Input"}`
- **Impact**: Critical navigation paths are missing

### 3. **Node Label Quality Issues**
- **Examples**: 
  - `"Correct Pin` (missing closing quote)
  - `"Available For Callout` (missing closing quote)
  - `Goodbye Thank` (truncated)
  - `Qualified You` (truncated)
- **Impact**: Generated code looks unprofessional and may have syntax issues

### 4. **Node Type Detection Problems**
- **Issue**: Some nodes that should be input nodes (PIN entry) are marked as decision nodes
- **Impact**: Missing proper `getDigits` configuration
- **Example**: "Enter Employee PIN" should have getDigits for 4-digit PIN input

### 5. **Flow Logic Issues**
- **Issue**: The "input" connection from welcome node is not being processed correctly
- **Expected**: Choice "1" should go to employee verification, but it's missing entirely
- **Impact**: Primary call flow path is broken

### 6. **Voice File Mapping Issues**
- **Issue**: Using generic voice files instead of content-specific ones
- **Example**: Welcome message using `callflow:ENV_VAR` and `callflow:1614` instead of electric callout specific files

## Comparison with Expected Output

### What We Expected:
```javascript
{
  label: "Welcome",
  getDigits: {
    numDigits: 1,
    validChoices: "1|3|7|9",
    maxTime: 7
  },
  branch: {
    "1": "Employee Verification",
    "3": "Need More Time", 
    "7": "Not Home",
    "9": "Repeat"
  }
}
```

### What We Got:
```javascript
{
  label: "Invalid Input",
  branch: {
    "3": "Second Message",
    error: "Invalid Input", 
    none: "Problems"
  }
}
```

## Impact Assessment

### High Priority Issues:
1. **Broken Navigation**: Missing choice "1" mapping means the primary call flow doesn't work
2. **Poor Node Identification**: Welcome node mislabeled makes debugging difficult
3. **Missing Input Handling**: PIN entry nodes lack proper getDigits configuration

### Medium Priority Issues:
1. **Label Quality**: Cosmetic but affects readability
2. **Voice File Optimization**: Functional but not optimal

## Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes Needed:
1. **Fix node start detection** to properly identify the welcome node
2. **Enhance connection parsing** to capture all DTMF mappings (1,3,7,9)
3. **Improve node labeling** to generate clean, complete labels
4. **Fix input node detection** for PIN entry scenarios
5. **Add proper getDigits configuration** for input nodes

### Testing Priority:
Test with simpler diagrams first to ensure core functionality works before testing complex multi-choice scenarios.

## Current Status
The converter shows improvements in some areas (playLog, quote escaping) but still has fundamental issues with complex welcome nodes and DTMF mapping that make it unsuitable for production use with electric callout scenarios.
